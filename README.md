# Ranbow: a haplotype assembler for polyploid genomes

Ranbow is a haplotype assembler for polyploid genomes. It has been developed for the haplotype assembly of the hexaploid sweet potato genome, which is highly heterozygous. Ranbow can also be applied to other polyploid genomes. After a first phasing, Ranbow utilizes the assembled haplotypes to improve the accuracy of variant calling results and to infer the evolutionary history of the organismÂ´s genome. Ranbow has three main modes of function:

'''ranbow hap''': for haplotyping
ranbow eval: for evaluating of the assemble haplotypes by gold standard (long) reads
ranbow phylo: for the phylogenetic analysis
